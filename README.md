# Smart-Farm/Garden-Monitoring-Red-Node ðŸŒ±  
It is a Smart Dashboard which can be used to monitor your Farms, Gardens and Aquariums. 
This project implements a **Smart Garden Monitoring System** using **Node-RED** for automating irrigation and improving farming efficiency.  

## Features  
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Automatically tracks moisture levels in the soil.  
- **Automated Irrigation**: Activates water pumps based on sensor thresholds.  
- **Temperature & Humidity Tracking**: Ensures optimal plant growth conditions.  
- **User Alerts**: Sends real-time notifications via email or SMS.  
- **Custom Dashboard**: Visualizes environmental data and irrigation schedules.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Node-RED**: Flow-based programming for IoT.  
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors.  
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi/Arduino (optional).  

I am further working on developing this for the Home Aquarium systems, where we can easliy monitor health of our fishes and feed them on time while we are out of town.
Feel free to contribute and enhance this project! ðŸŒŸ
